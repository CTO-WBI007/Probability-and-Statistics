# Basic Concepts in Probability  

## Random Test  

*Traits of random test:*  
1) Can be operated repetitively
2) All consequences are in expectations
3) The result of each single test is unpredictable

## Sample Space and Random Event  

The sample space $S$ includes all the events, so it is a certain event.  
We use the sign $\emptyset$ to define a impossible event.
